I am a fist-year PhD student at **[University of Edinburgh(UoE)](https://eng.ed.ac.uk/centre-electronics-frontiers)**, UK. I got my Master degree from **[Eindhoven University of Technology(TU/e)](https://www.tue.nl/en/)**, Netherlands and my bachelor degree from **[Hefei University of Technology(HFUT)](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/)**, China. My research focuses on designing digital hardware acceleration systems for large-scale AI models using novel architectures, aiming to overcome memory and computational bottlenecks. My current focus is on advancing hardware accelerators for LLMs, VLMs, and generative AI to enable next-generation intelligent computing.

<!--I am interested in **VLSI/ASIC/SoC Design, NoC, Neuromorphic Hardware and Efficient AI Hardware Accelerator**.-->

Here is my [CV](https://BoChen-Ye.github.io/files/CV.pdf), and I am looking for possible research collaboration. If you are interested in me, please feel free to contact me at any time.
